Scripts are `ModuleScript` instances. The `setupManager` is the only `Script`/`LocalScript` instance on the client and server.

They are located in `src/server/scripts` and `src/client/scripts`.

Scripts utilise [Classes](Classes/Index.md) to control larger game behavior. They are basically just regular scripts.
