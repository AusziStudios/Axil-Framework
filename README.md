- A cleaner way to structure a game project.
- OOP with easy inheritance to make code more reusable.
- Better communication between the client and server with the [Replicator](Classes/Replicator) class
  - Built in client-server replication: copy classes to the client
  - Events built into classes
- Easier way to access other scripts with the [Resource Module](Modules/ResourceModule).
