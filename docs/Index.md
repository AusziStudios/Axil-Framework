## What is it's purpose?
- A cleaner way to structure a game project. 
- OOP with easy inheritance to make code more reusable.
- Better communication between the client and server with the [Replicator](Axil-Framework/Classes/Replicator.md) class

  - Events built into classes
- Easier way to access other scripts with the [Resource Module](Axil-Framework/Modules/ResourceModule.md).
